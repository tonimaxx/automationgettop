Write
a
Program
to
check if any
number is a
magic
number or not.

A
number is said
to
be
a
magic
number if after
doing
sum
of
digits in
each
step and inturn
doing
sum
of
digits
of
that
sum,
the
ultimate
result(when
there is only
one
digit
left) is 1.
Example, consider
the
number:

Step
1: 163 = > 1 + 6 + 3 = 10
Step
2: 10 = > 1 + 0 = 1 = > Hence
163 is a
magic
number


def is_magicnumber(num):
    // convert
    num
    to
    string
    # 163
    strnum = list(str(num))
    # strnum = [1,6,3]

    # sum(strnum)


x = sum(strnum)
# x = 10

// conv
